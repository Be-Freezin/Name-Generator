# Name-Generator

 A simple solution to a problem i face regularly. SPending way to much time looking for bad ass nordic names for the characters i make while gaming.

 This was alot of fun to make, further cementing my knowledge of certain javascript concepts. Such as, random generation, for loops, function parameters,creating elements with JS, and just general syntax practice of javascript.

 I also dipped my toes into using svgs properly and doing some slight animation on certain svg elements. Now that i know how to do those, i can add alot of personality to certain things i create.
